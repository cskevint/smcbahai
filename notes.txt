Who we are?
What we are doing?

--------


"The betterment of the world can be accomplished to pure and goodly deeds, through a commendable and seemly conduct."

We are members of the Baha'i Faith community of San Mateo County. As Baha'is, we engaged in a process of forming strongs bonds of unity within our community involving people of all ages and backgrounds. This unity would manifest itself in service to the residents of the county, from young to old.

A pivotal concept in the Bahá’í teachings is that the refinement of one’s inner character and service to humanity are inseparable facets of life. Every individual in society has a duty to contribute to the betterment of society. We cannot work isolation. We can only be effective when we work together with others. Our knowledge, skills, talents and abilities come together to help us find solutions to the ills challenging our society.

A process of building a unified community can involve at a minimum, four activities that can create spaces for learning, reflection and action:

1. meetings that strengthen the devotional character of the community, where all generations can come together in prayer and loving unity
2. classes that nurture the tender hearts and minds of children through the learning of spiritual concepts, songs, prayers, stories and games 
3. groups that channel the surging energies of junior youth towards learning about the universe and making a contribution to the construction of a better world
4. circles of study that enable people of varied backgrounds to advance on equal footing and explore the application of the teachings to their individual and collective lives

These activities transform the hearts and minds of the individuals. Over time, they can have an effect on the structures of society, it's laws, economic principles, educational standards and, in general, the way that we interact with each other.

All men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing civilization. 

The Almighty beareth Me witness: To act like the beasts of the field is unworthy of man. Those virtues that befit his dignity are forbearance, mercy, compassion and loving-kindness towards all the peoples and kindreds of the earth.

Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and center your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.

The honor and distinction of the individual consist in this, that he among all the world’s multitudes should become a source of social good.

Is any larger bounty conceivable than this, that an individual, looking within himself, should find that by the confirming grace of God he has become the cause of peace and well-being, of happiness and advantage to his fellow men? No, by the one true God, there is no greater bliss, no more complete delight....

Blessed is he who preffereth his brother before himself.

Let your vision be world-embracing.

Be generous in prosperity, and thankful in adversity. 
Be worthy of the trust of thy neighbor, and look upon him with a bright and friendly face. 
Be a treasure to the poor, an admonisher to the rich, an answerer of the cry of the needy, a preserver of the sanctity of thy pledge. 
Be fair in thy judgment, and guarded in thy speech. 
Be unjust to no man, and show all meekness to all men. 

Be as a lamp unto them that walk in darkness, a joy to the sorrowful, a sea for the thirsty, a haven for the distressed, an upholder and defender of the victim of oppression. 

Let integrity and uprightness distinguish all thine acts. Be a home for the stranger, a balm to the suffering, a tower of strength for the fugitive. Be eyes to the blind, and a guiding light unto the feet of the erring. Be an ornament to the countenance of truth, a crown to the brow of fidelity, a pillar of the temple of righteousness, a breath of life to the body of mankind, an ensign of the hosts of justice, a luminary above the horizon of virtue, a dew to the soil of the human heart, an ark on the ocean of knowledge, a sun in the heaven of bounty, a gem on the diadem of wisdom, a shining light in the firmament of thy generation, a fruit upon the tree of humility.
