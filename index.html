<h1>Building Unified Communities</h1>
<h2>Efforts by the Baha'i Community of San Mateo County</h2>

<blockquote>
The betterment of the world can be accomplished to pure and goodly deeds, through a commendable and seemly conduct.
</blockquote>

<p>
We are members of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith community of San Mateo County. As Baha'is, we are engaged in a process of forming strongs bonds of unity within our community involving people of all ages and backgrounds. This unity would manifest itself in service to the residents of the county, from young to old. 
</p>

<blockquote>
	The honor and distinction of the individual consist in this, that he among all the world's multitudes should become a source of social good. 
</blockquote>

<p>
A pivotal concept in the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; teachings is that the refinement of one's inner character and service to humanity are inseparable facets of life. Every individual in society has a duty to contribute to the betterment of society. We cannot work isolation. We can only be effective when we work together with others. Our knowledge, skills, talents and abilities come together to help us find solutions to the ills challenging our society.
</p>

<blockquote>
	The principle of oneness, as enunciated by Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, involves much more than brotherly love and tolerance. It calls for a change in the very structures of society. It represents the final stage of a long evolutionary process in the collective life of humanity, a stage that will be marked by the emergence of a world civilization.
</blockquote>

<p>
A process of building a unified community can involve at a minimum, four activities that can create spaces for learning, reflection and action:
</p>
<ol class='core_activities'>
<li>
	<h5>Devotional Gatherings</h5>
 meetings that strengthen the devotional character of the community, where all generations can come together in prayer and loving unity
</li>
<li>
	<h5>Children's Classes</h5>
 classes that nurture the tender hearts and minds of children through the learning of spiritual concepts, songs, prayers, stories and games 
</li>
<li>
	<h5>Junior Youth Groups</h5>
 groups that channel the surging energies of junior youth towards learning about the universe and making a contribution to the construction of a better world
</li>
<li>
	<h5>Study Circles</h5>
 circles of study that enable people of varied backgrounds to advance on equal footing and explore the application of the teachings to their individual and collective lives
</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
	Be as a lamp unto them that walk in darkness, a joy to the sorrowful, a sea for the thirsty, a haven for the distressed, an upholder and defender of the victim of oppression. 
</blockquote>

<p>
These activities transform the hearts and minds of the individuals. Over time, they can have an effect on the structures of society, it's laws, economic principles, educational standards and, in general, the way that we interact with each other. A community must work together to train the future generations to think and act in a way that unifies rather than separates us.
